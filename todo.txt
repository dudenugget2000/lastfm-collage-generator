TODO
----
1. Understand each line of this program (easy enough I guess /s)
2. Add comments explaining each segment of the program
3. Add the ability to add more than the (currently) hard-coded 9 picture artist
limit for the collage (e.g., let the user be able to choose the amount of
artists displayed in his/her collage)
4. Add a fully functional (simple, one task) GUI for the program
5. Make sure it is cross-platform compatible
6. Add file that installs all dependencies when run
